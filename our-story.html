                    <h1>Our story</h1>
                    <p>It all started with a spark of an idea in August 2017.  
This time it was an unusually stubborn one which didn’t stop bothering me. It was just growing and growing, and it was becoming a part of my daily habits. 
After a while I knew I couldn’t resist its call anymore so I surrendered and I dedicated my life to it. 
ECHO, my brainchild was born.</p>

                    <p>
During my research I sadly realised there was an injustice in the UK charity sector where the largest 1.2% of charities in the UK receive 70% of the donations. Medium and small sized charities have no chance to keep up with the marketing battle for publicity. </p>

<p>Still every year hundreds of new non-profits are formed offering solutions for issues our society is facing. Their existence is essential in the bottom up approach of making impacts, however, they struggle to reach out to the majority of people who therefore don't have credible information about some of those issues at all.
On the other hand, after having donated to a certain cause, many people wish to be informed about how the money is put to use but there are no other steps made to make them feel important: no connection between them and the supported organisation, they are not informed about how their donation helped to reach certain goals, and they are not rewarded by any means. </p>
<p>Donation should be a selfless act, but it doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be rewarded.
There are over 200,000 registered charities in the UK, but we only hear about a handful of them on a daily basis. That is due to the fact that most of them act locally of course, but I still think that people need to know about their inspiring stories nationwide.</p>
<p>I believe today is the best time to start reforming the way we think about each other and find solutions as a community. 
Let’s spread the world together!</p>
