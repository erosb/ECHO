Here is where all the magic happens…</p><p>
But what are ECHO Adventures exactly?</p><p>
A fun tool where everyone wins!</p><p>
What if I told you that every single donation towards our partners has a chance to win a unique once-in-a-lifetime experience?</p><p>
Have you ever wondered how humble organisations working hard to solve real problems our society is facing with?</p><p>
Would you like to be part of an extraordinary journey where you could peek behind the scenes of their fascinating life where not many of us could ever step in before?</p><p>
Well, there you go!</p><p>
We constantly brainstorm hard to create epic experiences you will never forget. </p><p>
You will be most definitely telling this story to your grandchildren who will thank their superhero grandparent for playing a part in making it possible to breath fresh air, to swim in a plastic-free ocean and to have honey for breakfast. </p><p>
And don’t worry if your memory fades in those years. </p><p>
We make sure that our film crew won’t miss the best bits of your encounter, which will be recorded for the next many generations as motivation and inspiration.</p><p>
Oh, and the cherry on top? </p><p>
The profit we generate goes to those hard-working organisations to make sure that their positive energy will never run out of fuel.</p><p>
